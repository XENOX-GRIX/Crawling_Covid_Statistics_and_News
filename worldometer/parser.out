Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . start
    (1) start -> . STARTER skipCONTENT DATA CONTENT

    STARTER         shift and go to state 2

    start                          shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> start .



state 2

    (1) start -> STARTER . skipCONTENT DATA CONTENT
    (2) skipCONTENT -> . CONTENT skipCONTENT
    (3) skipCONTENT -> .

    CONTENT         shift and go to state 4
    DATA            reduce using rule 3 (skipCONTENT -> .)

    skipCONTENT                    shift and go to state 3

state 3

    (1) start -> STARTER skipCONTENT . DATA CONTENT

    DATA            shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (2) skipCONTENT -> CONTENT . skipCONTENT
    (2) skipCONTENT -> . CONTENT skipCONTENT
    (3) skipCONTENT -> .

    CONTENT         shift and go to state 4
    DATA            reduce using rule 3 (skipCONTENT -> .)

    skipCONTENT                    shift and go to state 6

state 5

    (1) start -> STARTER skipCONTENT DATA . CONTENT

    CONTENT         shift and go to state 7


state 6

    (2) skipCONTENT -> CONTENT skipCONTENT .

    DATA            reduce using rule 2 (skipCONTENT -> CONTENT skipCONTENT .)


state 7

    (1) start -> STARTER skipCONTENT DATA CONTENT .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (start -> STARTER skipCONTENT DATA CONTENT .)
